# Fizz Buzz

![Fizz_Buzz][1]

Fizz Buzz is a typical interview question which tests the developers knowledge of
flow control and operators. For the purposes of this repository, the following
rules apply:

> Write a program that prints the numbers 1 to 100. However, for multiples of three,
> print "Fizz" instead of the number. Meanwhile, for multiples of five, print "Buzz"
> instead of the number. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five,
> print "FizzBuzz"

I was tempted to open this up such that the user could supply any number, but I think
we get plenty of IO with some of the other projects in this repo.
