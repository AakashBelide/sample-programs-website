According to Wikipedia, Visual Basic .NET (VB.NET) is a programming language 
that was created by Microsoft in 2001. Beyond that, Wikipedia doesn’t have 
much to offer in terms of historical information, so let’s move on.

In terms of features, however, Wikipedia has a little more to offer. For 
instance, VB.NET is statically typed, but the type system is both strong 
and weak as well as safe and unsafe.

As for syntax, VB.NET is structured which reminds me of languages like 
Pascal and MATLAB where blocks of code are marked by keywords—rather than 
braces or whitespace.

Beyond that, VB.NET has several versions. In fact, VB.NET only really refers 
to the language before 2005, but the syntax is largely the same today. Of 
course, I’ve sort of lumped them together in the same way I’ve recognized 
Python as one language instead of two.[^1]
