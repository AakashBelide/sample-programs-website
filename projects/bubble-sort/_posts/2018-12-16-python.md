In this article, we'll be tackling Bubble Sort in Python.

## How to Implement the Solution

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys
from functools import reduce


def bubble_sort(xs):
    def pass_list(xs):
        if len(xs) <= 1:
            return xs
        x0 = xs[0]
        x1 = xs[1]
        if x1 < x0:
            del xs[1]
            return [x1] + pass_list(xs)
        return [x0] + pass_list(xs[1:])
    return reduce(lambda acc, _ : pass_list(acc), xs, xs[:])


def input_list(list_str):
    return [int(x.strip(" "), 10) for x in list_str.split(',')]


def exit_with_error():
    print('Usage: please provide a list of at least two integers to sort in the format “1, 2, 3, 4, 5”')
    sys.exit(1)


def main(args):
    try:
        xs = input_list(args[0])
        if len(xs) <= 1:
            exit_with_error()
        print(bubble_sort(xs))
    except (IndexError,ValueError):
        exit_with_error()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main(sys.argv[1:])
```

## How to Run Solution

Breaking down this solution bottom up,

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main(sys.argv[1:])
```

This bit of code checks to see if this is the main module run, if it is it then calls the main function and passes user input to it.
In this case the user input would be a string of numbers like so "2, 1, 10, 5, 3" (to sort).

```python
def main(args):
    try:
        xs = input_list(args[0])
        if len(xs) <= 1:
            exit_with_error()
        print(bubble_sort(xs))
    except (IndexError,ValueError):
        exit_with_error()
```

This is the main function of this file. It parses the input, then calls our bubble sort function (and prints the results).
It also deals with any errors raises.

```python
def input_list(list_str):
    return [int(x.strip(" "), 10) for x in list_str.split(',')]
```

This function takes a string like `"2, 1, 10, 5, 3"`, and turns into a list of numbers. It does using a list comprehension it takes a
list as input in this case `list_str.split(',')`, list of strings split by comma (,) so our original input string becomes `["2", " 1", " 10", " 5", " 3"]`.
Then for each element in the list `for x in ...` (we call it x),  we do something to it.

In this example we convert it into a decimal integer, `int(x.strip(" "), 10)`
`x.strip(" ")`, removes any whitespace so " 1" becomes "1", then int("1", 10) converts the string "1" into a decimal number in this case very simply 1. This is done 
for every item in the list so our original input of `"2, 1, 10, 5, 3"` becomes `[2, 1, 10, 5, 3]`.

```python
def exit_with_error():
    print('Usage: please provide a list of at least two integers to sort in the format “1, 2, 3, 4, 5”')
    sys.exit(1)
```
