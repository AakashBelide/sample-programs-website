# Baklava

Baklava is a Turkish dessert, and its shape is like an equilateral quadrangle.
It is used as an example for programming education in Turkish schools. The following
is the expected output:

```
           *
          ***
         *****
        *******
       *********
      ***********
     *************
    ***************
   *****************
  *******************
 *********************
  *******************
   *****************
    ***************
     *************
      ***********
       *********
        *******
         *****
          ***
           *
```

In general, this solution can be accomplished using a pair of loops. Of course, all
possible programs are welcome.
