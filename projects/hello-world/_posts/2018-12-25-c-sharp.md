## How to Implement the Solution

Now, we can implement Hello World in C# in a couple of ways. For simplicity, I’ll share the minimalist approach but be aware that there are more complete ways to do this:

class HelloWorld {
  static void Main() {
    System.Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
  }
}
If you read the Hello World in Java tutorial, then this probably looks very similar. In fact, C# shares a lot of the same look and feel as Java. With that being the case, I’ll only highlight the major pieces here.

Before we can print, we have to create a class. Inside our class, we declare the main method. And inside our main method, we run our print command. The syntax and core libraries are a little different, but it feels eerily similar to Java.

## How to Run Solution

Perhaps the easiest way to run this solution would be to open up an online C# compiler. Just copy the code from above and drop it into the editor before hitting run.

Alternatively, we can download Visual Studio or Mono to run C# locally. Of course, we’ll want a copy of the solution as well. Refer to the manual of the various tools to run C#.

As far as I know, there aren’t any easy ways to run C# code from the command line, but I imagine it can be done.
