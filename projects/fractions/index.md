languages like python have built-in utilities or functions for working with fractions.
Many of these fractions functions follow a similar pattern across programming languages:
Takes a numerator and a denomenator as an attribute.
Perform basic arithmatic and relational operations with operator overloading.

## Requirements

In general, a fractions library should perform the following:

1. Perform arithmatic operation like multiplications, addition etc.
2. Give output for relational operations like >=, >, == etc.

More specifically, begin with creating object instance of fraction class with two attributes:
numerator and denomenator.Using operator overloading feature of langauge implement basic arithmatic
and relational operaions.

## Testing

Verify that the actual output matches the expected output.
