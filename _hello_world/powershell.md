Welcome to a guest installment of the Hello World in Every Language series.
I‚Äôm Devin Leaman, otherwise known as Alcha, and I‚Äôll be covering Hello World
in PowerShell, a language that appeared in 2006.

## Hello World in PowerShell<sup>1</sup>

Enough background, let‚Äôs actually get something working üòä

```powershell
Write-Host 'Hello, World!'
```

To execute this code, open a PowerShell console on any Windows machine as it
comes installed by default. You‚Äôll see the reply output in the window like so:

TODO: insert image <Hello World Console>

As is the case with most modern scripting languages, getting a Hello World
sample running is really easy.

## How to Run the Solution<sup>1</sup>

Instead of running the commands directly within the console though, write your
scripts in a file and call the file when necessary. Download a copy of the
Hello-World.ps1 file from the repository and open a console.

Now, navigate to wherever you downloaded the script and execute it by calling
it like so:

```console
.\Hello-World.ps1
```

This calls the script and returns the output to the console:

TODO: insert image Hello World Script
