Job sequencing is an optimization problem where the goal is to maximize the
profit earned by completing jobs. In this particular rendition of the problem,
jobs have both a profit and a deadline, and all jobs can be completed in the
same amount of time:

| Job      | J1  | J2  | J3  | J4  |
| -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Profit   | 25  | 15  | 10  | 5   |
| Deadline | 3   | 1   | 2   | 2   |
