Hello World in PicoLisp
Without further ado, let’s implement Hello World in PicoLisp:

(prinl "Hello, World!")
And, perhaps unsurprisingly, that’s it! With a single line, we can print Hello World in PicoLisp.

Of course, let’s break down what’s happening. Since PicoLisp is a dialect of Lisp, we can expect a ton of parentheses. In fact, our solution requires a single set of parentheses at a minimum.

Inside the parentheses, we have a function call. In this case, the print function is named prinl and the input is our “Hello, World!” string. When executed, our string will print to the console.

How to Run the Solution
If we want to run the solution, we can try an online editor. However, I ran into some problems with this particular editor.

Alternatively, if we have access to a Unix, Linux, or Mac machine, we can easily download and install the latest version of PicoLisp. That said, @cess11 has a great video proving that this solution works:

And, that’s it! If implemented correctly, the solution should print “Hello, World!” to the console.
