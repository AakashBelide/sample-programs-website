# Hello World

Hello World is a standard program used to introduce a programming language.
As a result, the rules are pretty simple: print "Hello, World!" to standard
output. Ideally, the solution should be as simple as possible.

## Requirements

To properly implement Hello World, submit a file called Hello
World using the appropriate conventions for your language of choice. Upon
execution, this file should print "Hello, World!" to standard output. That's it!

## Testing

Because this program is so simple, there is nothing to test beyond execution.
