A minimum spanning tree is defined as the minimum set of edges needed to connect
every node in a graph without cycles. For our purposes, we're concerned with
weighted undirected graphs. In other words, we want to find the minimum cost
spanning tree.

For example, let's say we have the following graph:

TODO: insert graph image

Then, a possible minimum spanning tree would have the lowest total weight
while also connected all nodes without cycles.
