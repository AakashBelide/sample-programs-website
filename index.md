Welcome to Sample Programs in Every Language, a collection of code snippets
in as many languages as possible. Thanks for taking an interest in our project!

The Sample Programs in Every Language collection currently contains
{{ site.posts | size }} articles written by {{ site.data.authors | size }}
authors. If you'd like to contribute to this growing project, check out
our [contributing doc][4] for more information.

Otherwise, dive into our documentation which is organized in two ways:
by [project][1] or by [language][2]. Feel free to browse these pages to learn
more about our project.

Alternatively, you can dive right into the latest articles below:
