    Jeremy grew up in a small town where he enjoyed playing soccer and video
    games, practicing taekwondo, and trading Pok√©mon cards. Once out of the nest,
    he pursued a Bachelors in Computer Engineering with a minor in Game Design.
    After college, he spent about two years writing software for a major
    engineering company. Today, he pursues a PhD in Computer Science in order
    to ultimately land a teaching gig. In his spare time, Jeremy enjoys spending
    time with his wife, playing Overwatch, practicing trombone, watching Penguins
    hockey, and traveling the world.
