Once again, I took to [Wikipedia][2] to learn a bit about Java and its history.

According to Wikipedia, Java is a general-purpose language that was designed with portability in mind. In other words, compile once and run anywhere. Originally called Oak, Java was developed in 1991 where the syntax was largely influenced by C/C++.

Today, Java exists as one of the most popular languages in the industry with uses that range from database management to app development. Since its inception, Java has gone through nine iterations and two companies: Sun Microsystems and Oracle Corporation, the current owners.

As a language, Java has received several complaints. For instance, many developers despise Java for its verbosity and performance. That said, the language has many great features like garbage collection which offset some of these complaints.
