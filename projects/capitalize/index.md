In this article, we'll tackle the Capitalize program, its requirements, and how
to test it.

## Description

This simple program picks a string and return the first letter of it in uppercase.

## Requirements

For this sample program, each solution should return the string with the first letter in uppercase.

```
string -> String
react -> React
java -> Java
car -> Car
a long string term: A long string term
```

In addition, there should be some error handling for situations where the user
doesn't input any string or the content passed to function is not a string(i.e number, float or object)

## Testing

Verify that the actual output matches the expected output. See the
[requirements][1] section for an example of the expected output.
