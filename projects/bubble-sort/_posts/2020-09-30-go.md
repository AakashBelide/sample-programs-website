In this article, we'll be tackling Bubble Sort in Go.

## How to Implement the Solution

At this point, let's dig into the code a bit. The following sections break
down the Bubble Sort in Go functionality.

### Solution

```go
package main

import (
	"encoding/json"
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"regexp"
	"strconv"
	"strings"
)

func bubbleSort(list []int) []int {
	swapped := true
	for swapped {
		swapped = false
		for i := 0; i < len(list)-1; i++ {
			if list[i] > list[i+1] {
				n := list[i]
				list[i] = list[i+1]
				list[i+1] = n
				swapped = true
			}
		}
	}
	return list
}

func swap(list []int, firstIndex int, secondIndex int) bool {
	if list[firstIndex] > list[secondIndex] {
		x := list[firstIndex]
		list[firstIndex] = list[secondIndex]
		list[secondIndex] = x
		return true
	}
	return false
}

func strToSliceInt(strList string) []int {
	list := regexp.MustCompile(", ?").Split(strList, -1)
	if len(list) < 2 {
		exitWithError()
	}
	var nums []int
	for _, num := range list {
		n, err := strconv.Atoi(num)
		if err != nil {
			exitWithError()
		}
		nums = append(nums, n)
	}
	return nums
}

func sliceIntToString(list []int) (out string) {
	bytes, _ := json.Marshal(list)
	out = strings.Replace(string(bytes), ",", ", ", -1)
	out = strings.Trim(out, "[]")
	return
}

func exitWithError() {
	fmt.Println("Usage: please provide a list of at least two integers to sort in the format \"1, 2, 3, 4, 5\"")
	os.Exit(1)
}

func main() {
	if len(os.Args) != 2 {
		exitWithError()
	}

	nums := strToSliceInt(os.Args[1])
	nums = bubbleSort(nums)
	fmt.Println(sliceIntToString(nums))
}
```

### The Main Function

Breaking down this solution bottom up,

```go
func main() {
	if len(os.Args) != 2 {
		exitWithError()
	}

	nums := strToSliceInt(os.Args[1])
	nums = bubbleSort(nums)
	fmt.Println(sliceIntToString(nums))
}
```
This is the main function of this file. It parses the  form Args, assures that there is enough elements for it to be sorted, the converts the string to integers, then calls our bubble sort function, and finally prints the results.
It also deals with any errors raised.

### Transform Input Parameters

```go
func strToSliceInt(strList string) []int {
	list := regexp.MustCompile(", ?").Split(strList, -1)
	if len(list) < 2 {
		exitWithError()
	}
	var nums []int
	for _, num := range list {
		n, err := strconv.Atoi(num)
		if err != nil {
			exitWithError()
		}
		nums = append(nums, n)
	}
	return nums
}
```

This function takes a string like `"2, 1, 10, 5, 3"`, and turns into a list of numbers.
It does this using a list comprehension, first we need to convert our string into a
list `Split(strList, -1)` which is a list of strings split by comma (,). So our
original input string becomes `["2", " 1", " 10", " 5", " 3"]`.
Then for each element in the list `for _, num := ...` ,  we do something to it.

In this example we convert it into a decimal integer, `strconv.Atoi(num)`. After that each of the newly converted integers are converted added to the new list `nums`.

```go
func sliceIntToString(list []int) (out string) {
	bytes, _ := json.Marshal(list)
	out = strings.Replace(string(bytes), ",", ", ", -1)
	out = strings.Trim(out, "[]")
	return
}
```

This function takes a list of integers like `[2, 1, 10,  5, 3]`, and turns into a string.
It does this using a list comprehension, first we need to convert our list of integers into a
string `bytes, _ := json.Marshal(list)`. So our
original input string becomes `"[2,1,10,5,3]"`.
Then we replace the commas with commas and a space `"[2, 1, 10, 5, 3]"`. Finally, we remove the square brackets before returning the string `out = strings.Trim(out, "[]")`.


### Throw Errors

```go
func exitWithError() {
	fmt.Println("Usage: please provide a list of at least two integers to sort in the format \"1, 2, 3, 4, 5\"")
	os.Exit(1)
}
```

This function prints a message and then exits the script with an error, `os.exit(1)`.
If any non-zero value is returned then the program didn't complete properly.
This function is called if the user input isn't correct.

### Bubble Sort

```go
func bubbleSort(list []int) []int {
	swapped := true
	for swapped {
		swapped = false
		for i := 0; i < len(list)-1; i++ {
			if list[i] > list[i+1] {
				n := list[i]
				list[i] = list[i+1]
				list[i+1] = n
				swapped = true
			}
		}
	}
	return list
}
```

Finally we're at the real meat and potatoes of the script. This function takes an unsorted integer
list and returns a sorted list, using the bubble sort algorithm. This function `bubble_sort` has
another function inside of it `pass_list`, also called a closure. The nested function can access
the variables of the parent function but as read-only, they cannot change the variable values.

The `pass_list` function does one pass of the list and makes sure it's sorted, it does by deleting
elements from the list if they're sorted and comparing the next two.

For example, if `[3, 2, 5, 1]` is the input:

* First we compare 2, 3
* 2 < 3
* Delete 2 from the list `del xs[1]`
* Call `pass_list`, `[2] + pass_list(3,5,1)`

So we combine the output of pass_list with 2.

Taking a look at the time `pass_list` is called.

* Compare 3, 5
* 3 < 5
* This time we don't delete 3, we then pass every element of the list except the first one (3) `xs[1:]`
* Call `pass_list` `[3] + pass_list(5,1)`.

The final bit of the code is what calls `pass_list`, where `acc` parameter is the `xs` list.
The reduce function is used to call `pass_list`, multiple times and `xs[:]` is a copy of the
`xs` so when `xs` is changed `xs[:]` is unaffected. The `reduce` function is used to loop
through every element, it (`reduce`) it uses the output of the last iteration as input to
the next one.

For example:

* For input `[10, 3, 2, 5, 7]` output is `[3, 2, 5, 7, 10]`
* Then input `[3, 2, 5, 7, 10]` output is `[2, 3, 5, 7, 10]`
* Then input is `[2, 3, 5, 7, 10]` output is `[2, 3, 5, 7, 10]`
* ...

## How to Run Solution

If we want to run this program, we should probably download a copy of [Bubble Sort in Python](https://github.com/TheRenegadeCoder/sample-programs/blob/master/archive/p/python/bubble-sort.py). 
After that, we should make sure we have the latest Python interpreter.
From there, we can run the following command in the terminal:

`python bubble-sort.py "3, 2, 10, 6, 1, 7"`

Alternatively, we can copy the solution into an online Python interpreter and hit run.
