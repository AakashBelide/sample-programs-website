# Roman Numeral Conversion

Roman numerals are the numbers that were used in ancient Rome, which employed combinations of letters from
the Latin alphabet (I, V, X, L, C, D and M).

These following table shows the letter to decimal mapping:

Letter | Decimal
-------|--------
I      | 1
V      | 5
X      | 10
L      | 50
C      | 100
D      | 500
M      | 1000

Using this table, write a sample program which accepts a Roman numeral and outputs it as a decimal.
